Grid search looks at every possible combination of hyperparameters to find the best model, random search only selects and tests a random combination of hyperparameters.

Support Vector Machines are discriminative because they fit a hyperplane which separates two classes.
A discriminative model directly learns the conditional probability distribution P(y|x).
Generative model learns the joint probability P(x,y) and then transform it to P(y|x) by using the Bayes rule.

Removing outliers will not help because one of the properties of SVM is that it effectively ignores all the data that is far from the decision boundary,
assuming that the two classes are linearly separable in your feature space. 

SVMs are effective models for binary classification tasks, although by default, they are not effective at imbalanced classification
